SaveBite - Capstone Project Document
Project Overview
SaveBite is an innovative, community-driven food waste management platform designed to reduce food wastage, promote sustainable consumption, and ensure excess food reaches those in need. The system connects restaurants, grocery stores, households, and NGOs through a digital platform where surplus food can be listed, tracked, and redistributed efficiently. SaveBite aims to tackle the global food waste crisis by enabling transparency, traceability, and smart resource allocation.
Inspiration
Every year, millions of tons of edible food are wasted, even as millions go hungry. A significant portion of this waste comes from restaurants, events, and households where excess food is discarded due to a lack of awareness or proper distribution channels. SaveBite is built to combat this issue by providing a platform that bridges the gap between food donors and recipients, empowering communities to make a real difference through technology.
Real-World Problems & Solutions
1. Excess Food Waste
Problem: Restaurants, grocery stores, and households often throw away surplus food due to lack of proper redistribution channels.
 Solution: SaveBite allows users to list excess food on the platform in real-time, where verified NGOs or individuals in need can claim and collect it.
2. Hunger & Food Insecurity
Problem: Many communities face food scarcity, especially marginalized groups and low-income families.
 Solution: SaveBite helps redistribute food efficiently to those in need, reducing hunger while preventing waste.
3. Lack of Awareness & Engagement
Problem: People are often unaware of the impact of food waste or ways to contribute to reducing it.
 Solution: SaveBite features community engagement tools, awareness campaigns, and a leaderboard system to encourage responsible food practices.
4. No Real-Time Tracking or Matching
Problem: Existing food donation systems are slow, with no real-time updates or intelligent matchmaking.
 Solution: SaveBite uses real-time updates, geolocation, and AI-powered matching to connect food donors with nearby recipients instantly.
